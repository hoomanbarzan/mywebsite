Safe and accurate execution of surgeries to date mainly rely on preoperative plans generated based on preoperative imaging. Frequent intraoperative interaction with such patient images during the intervention is needed, which is currently a cumbersome process given that such images are generally displayed on peripheral two-dimensional (2D) monitors and controlled through interface devices that are outside the sterile filed. This study proposes a new medical image control concept based on a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) that allows for hands-free and direct image manipulation without relying on gesture recognition methods or voice commands.

A software environment was designed for displaying three-dimensional (3D) patient images onto external monitors, with the functionality of hands-free image manipulation based on the user’s brain signals detected by the BCI device (i.e., visually evoked signals).

In a user study, ten orthopedic surgeons completed a series of standardized image manipulation tasks to navigate and locate predefined 3D points in a Computer Tomography (CT) image using the developed interface. Accuracy was assessed as the mean error between the predefined locations (ground truth) and the navigated locations by the surgeons. All surgeons rated the performance and potential intraoperative usability in a standardized survey using a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree).

When using the developed interface, the mean image control error was 15.51 mm (SD: 9.57). The user’s acceptance was rated with a Likert score of 4.07 (SD: 0.96) while the overall impressions of the interface was rated as 3.77 (SD: 1.02) by the users. We observed a significant correlation between the users’ overall impression and the calibration score they achieved. 
The use of the developed BCI, that allowed for a purely brain-guided medical image control, yielded promising results, and showed its potential for future intraoperative applications. The major limitation to overcome was noted as the interaction delay.
