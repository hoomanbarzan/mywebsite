<h2>Camera obscura!</h2>

How an image is projected through a pinhole to a light-sensitive film, this very basic principle of film photography, photogrammetry and computer vision has fascinated me so much so that I have kept it very near and dear to me, in my work and in my life! Cameras are my thing! I enjoy working with them in any shape, size, modality and format!

In my free time, I enjoy working with a varity of Camera ocscura! most of them built at least a few decades before I was even born! This means that my shooting experience is not hassle-free! After developing my exposed film in special chemicals, I usually run them through a digitization process to create the raster copies. Sometimes I project my film on photo-sensitive paper (you may recall this from old movies) and create my photos in a completely analogue process (from shooting to printing).

Being in the outdoors is another passion of mine, mix it with analogue photography or videography, you see me comfortably smiling in my habitat! I am very fortunate to have been living in multiple citied that were in close vacinity of a glourious mountain ranges. Calgary and the Rockies! Vancouver and the Pacific coast mountains! Tehran and the Alborz mountains! Zurich and the Alps! Having a passion in analogue photography, means that I should carry my old (sometimes ancient) camera equipment that can easily weight a good few pounds on my hikes. Is it worth it? I let some of the photos speak for themselves ...
